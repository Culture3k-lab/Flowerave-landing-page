        <p className='description'>Flowerave developers have implemented a Telegram bot functioning to sell event tickets in TON cryptocurrency. The bot itself will leverage the power of TON blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer payments, secure contracts and data storage. Once the user makes a payment, the bot also updates their account in TON blockchain, issuing an NFT ticket. This NFT functions as a pass for the event - when presented to the host, the NFT will be scanned and compared to TON blockchain records to confirm the purchase and continue with the registration process.</p>
